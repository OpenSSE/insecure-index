This repository provides several implementation of persistent multi-maps that can be used as a database index.
As the name suggests, the implementations are insecure in the sense that neither the database, nor the queries are encrypted.
They are here only to provide reference points when comparing encrypted databases with non-encrypted ones.

If you search for implementations of encrypted databases, look at [OpenSSE's schemes repository](<https://github.com/OpenSSE/opensse-schemes>).
